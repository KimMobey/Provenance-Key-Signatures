# Provenance-Key-Signatures
An opensource key generation and database referral system for artists and collectors to safeguard against art fraud and theft

RAISSON D'ETRE This has been a brutal time for artists and creatives. Cultural activities around the world have been shut down to protect our most vulnerable family members. South Africa's very stringent lockdown dealt a devastating blow to my studio and many other artists. Shipping, buying supplies and even selling locally became illegal and much of my studio's income vanished overnight, with many patrons and collectors struggling to fulfil commitments. Worse yet, corruption and government opacity means that relief funds have been stolen and many artists and small businesses face foreclosure or worse.

Things are slowly becoming easier and, in order to recover from the slow release and after effects of the lockdown, I've decided to create a new kind of print to support my studio even if there are future lockdowns. I want other artists to be able to use it too so I'm open-sourcing it as best I can.

OVERVIEW Each individual print contains a unique digital key embedded in the image. This is then recorded in the studio as a part of the Catalogue Raisonne. The image is then printed by printmakers in any selected country or locale and shipped directly to the client.

I'll use an open source key generator and database to ensure that each key is unique and easily accessed. In addition, a signed, physical print out within the studio will serve as a more conventional "art world" proof and prevents art fraud, a huge concern for artists and collectors alike. This means that buyers and future owners of each piece can easily contact the studio to look up the key as proof that they have a legitimate print. 

Duplication of any print essentially renders it invalid and each print is traceable to a printmaker so it is not in their interest to get caught committing fraud.

Of course I have to learn how to use Github first... .
